Each time a pollinator (such as a honey bee, bumble bee, solitary wild bee, or other non-bee insect) lands on a flower, that's a visit! All the data here is collected by people like you going out and completing surveys with the WiBee App. We invite you to explore the data to see what wild bee populations and their flower visit rates look like across Wisconsin. You can also compare your own data in the WiBee app to the summary data presented here in this dashboard to help you make decisions about managing your local pollinator community or track any change over time. As you explore the data below, remember that this dashboard is a work in progress. If you have specific suggestions, please contact us!"),
